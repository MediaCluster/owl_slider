If you want your Slider look like something like this
|img-SyncedOwles_Slider|


The each content-element of a slide is synchronized with its slide-element. 
All content-elements are displayed at once, but each of them if clicked scrolls the slider to the maching slide.

To see how it works and to try it out please visit
